```

Different item types can be starred. Every item in the list has a `type` property, the other property depend on the type of item. The possible types are:

- **`message`** : the item will have a `message` property containing a [message object](/docs/messages)
- **`file`** : this item will have a `file` property containing a [file object](/types/file).
- **`file_comment`** : the item will have a `file` property containing the [file object](/types/file) and a `comment` property containing the file comment.
- **`channel`** : the item will have a `channel` property containing the channel ID.
- **`im`** : the item will have a `channel` property containing the channel ID for this direct message.
- **`group`** : the item will have a `group` property containing the channel ID for the private group.

The paging information contains the `count` of files returned, the `total`number of items starred, the `page` of results returned in this response and the total number of `pages` available. Please note that the max `count` value is `1000` and the max `page` value is `100`.

## Errors

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should _always_ check the value of the `ok` params in the response.

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `user_not_found` | Value passed for `user` was invalid |
| `user_not_visible` | The requested user is not visible to the calling user |
| `not_authed` | No authentication token provided. |
| `invalid_auth` | Invalid authentication token. |
| `account_inactive` | Authentication token is for a deleted user or team. |
| `user_is_bot` | This method cannot be called by a bot user. |
| `invalid_arg_name` | The method was passed an argument whose name falls outside the bounds of common decency. This includes very long names and names with non-alphanumeric characters other than `_`. If you get this error, it is typically an indication that you have made a _very_ malformed API call. |
| `invalid_array_arg` | The method was passed a PHP-style array argument (e.g. with a name like `foo[7]`). These are never valid with the Slack API. |
| `invalid_charset` | The method was called via a `POST` request, but the `charset` specified in the `Content-Type` header was invalid. Valid charset names are: `utf-8` `iso-8859-1`. |
| `invalid_form_data` | The method was called via a `POST` request with `Content-Type` `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`, but the form data was either missing or syntactically invalid. |
| `invalid_post_type` | The method was called via a `POST` request, but the specified `Content-Type` was invalid. Valid types are: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` `multipart/form-data` `text/plain`. |
| `missing_post_type` | The method was called via a `POST` request and included a data payload, but the request did not include a `Content-Type` header. |
| `request_timeout` | The method was called via a `POST` request, but the `POST` data was either missing or truncated. |

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended. |
| `superfluous_charset` | The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous. |
