## Response

```
{
    "ok": true,
    "emoji": {
        "bowtie": "https:\/\/my.slack.com\/emoji\/bowtie\/46ec6f2bb0.png",
        "squirrel": "https:\/\/my.slack.com\/emoji\/squirrel\/f35f40c0e0.png",
        "shipit": "alias:squirrel",
        â€¦
    }
}
```

The `emoji` property contains a map of name/url pairs, one for each custom emoji used by the team. The `alias:` pseudo-protocol will be used where the emoji is an alias, the string following the colon is the name of the other emoji this emoji is an alias to.
