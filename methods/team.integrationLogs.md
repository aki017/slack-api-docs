Logs can contain data for either a service or API application. If it's a service, `service_id` and `service_type` will be returned, and if it's an API application, `app_id` and `app_type` will be returned.

Logs can also contain different `change_types`. The possible types are: `added`, `removed`, `enabled`, `disabled`, and `updated`.

If the log entry is an RSS feed, the log will also contain `rss_feed` (with a value of `true`), `rss_feed_change_type`, `rss_feed_title` and `rss_feed_url`.

When a `disabled` event is logged, its log entry will also contain a `reason` for why the event occurred. The list of possible reasons are:

- `user` - Manually disabled by user
- `rate_limits` - Rate limits exceeded
- `slack` - Disabled by Slack
- `errors` - Too many errors
- `system` - A system change (i.e. channel archived)
- `admin` - Admin (i.e. user deleted)
- `api_decline` - User declied the API TOS
- `deauth` - Service deauthorized

The paging information contains the `count` of logs returned, the `total` number of logs, the `page` of results returned in this response and the total number of `pages` available.

## Errors

This table lists the expected errors that this method will return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should _always_ check the value of the `ok` params in the response.

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `not_authed` | No authentication token provided. |
| `invalid_auth` | Invalid authentication token. |
| `account_inactive` | Authentication token is for a deleted user or team. |
| `user_is_bot` | This method cannot be called by a bot user. |
