Logs can contain data for either a service or API application. If it's a service, `service_id` and `service_type` will be returned, and if it's an API application, `app_id` and `app_type` will be returned.

Logs can also contain different `change_types`. The possible types are: `added`, `removed`, `enabled`, `disabled`, and `updated`.

If the log entry is an RSS feed, the log will also contain `rss_feed` (with a value of `true`), `rss_feed_change_type`, `rss_feed_title` and `rss_feed_url`.

When a `disabled` event is logged, its log entry will also contain a `reason` for why the event occurred. The list of possible reasons are:

- `user` - Manually disabled by user
- `rate_limits` - Rate limits exceeded
- `slack` - Disabled by Slack
- `errors` - Too many errors
- `system` - A system change (i.e. channel archived)
- `admin` - Admin (i.e. user deleted)
- `api_decline` - User declied the API TOS
- `deauth` - Service deauthorized

The paging information contains the `count` of logs returned, the `total` number of logs, the `page` of results returned in this response and the total number of `pages` available.

## Errors

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should _always_ check the value of the `ok` params in the response.

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `not_authed` | No authentication token provided. |
| `invalid_auth` | Invalid authentication token. |
| `account_inactive` | Authentication token is for a deleted user or team. |
| `user_is_bot` | This method cannot be called by a bot user. |
| `invalid_arg_name` | The method was passed an argument whose name falls outside the bounds of common decency. This includes very long names and names with non-alphanumeric characters other than `_`. If you get this error, it is typically an indication that you have made a _very_ malformed API call. |
| `invalid_array_arg` | The method was passed a PHP-style array argument (e.g. with a name like `foo[7]`). These are never valid with the Slack API. |
| `invalid_charset` | The method was called via a `POST` request, but the `charset` specified in the `Content-Type` header was invalid. Valid charset names are: `utf-8` `iso-8859-1`. |
| `invalid_form_data` | The method was called via a `POST` request with `Content-Type` `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`, but the form data was either missing or syntactically invalid. |
| `invalid_post_type` | The method was called via a `POST` request, but the specified `Content-Type` was invalid. Valid types are: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` `multipart/form-data` `text/plain`. |
| `missing_post_type` | The method was called via a `POST` request and included a data payload, but the request did not include a `Content-Type` header. |
| `request_timeout` | The method was called via a `POST` request, but the `POST` data was either missing or truncated. |

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended. |
| `superfluous_charset` | The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous. |
