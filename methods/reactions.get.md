## Response

The response contains the item with reactions.

```
{
    "type": "message",
    "channel": "C2147483705",
    "message": {
        ...
        "reactions": [
            {
                "name": "astonished",
                "count": 3,
                "users": ["U1", "U2", "U3"]
            },
            {
                "name": "clock1"
                "count": 2,
                "users": ["U1", "U2", "U3"]
            }
        ]
    },
},
```

Different item types can be reacted to. The item returned has a `type` property, the other properties depend on the type of item. The possible types are:

- **`message`** : the item will have a `message` property containing a [message object](/docs/messages) and a `channel` property containing the channel ID for the message.
- **`file`** : this item will have a `file` property containing a [file object](/types/file).
- **`file_comment`** : the item will have a `file` property containing the [file object](/types/file) and a `comment` property containing the file comment.

The users array in the `reactions` property might not always contain all users that have reacted (we limit it to X users, and X might change), however `count` will always represent the count of all users who made that reaction (i.e. it may be greater than `users.length`). If the authenticated user has a given reaction then they are guaranteed to appear in the `users` array, regardless of whether `count` is greater than `users.length` or not. If the complete list of users is required they can still be obtained by specifying the `full` argument.

## Errors

This table lists the expected errors that this method will return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should _always_ check the value of the `ok` params in the response.

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bad_timestamp` | Value passed for `timestamp` was invalid. |
| `file_not_found` | File specified by `file` does not exist. |
| `file_comment_not_found` | File comment specified by `file_comment` does not exist. |
| `message_not_found` | Message specified by `channel` and `timestamp` does not exist. |
| `no_item_specified` | `file`, `file_comment`, or combination of `channel` and `timestamp` was not specified. |
| `not_authed` | No authentication token provided. |
| `invalid_auth` | Invalid authentication token. |
| `account_inactive` | Authentication token is for a deleted user or team. |
| `invalid_array_arg` | The method was passed a PHP-style array argument (e.g. with a name like `foo[7]`). These are never valid with the Slack API. |
| `invalid_charset` | The method was called via a `POST` request, but the `charset` specified in the `Content-Type` header was invalid. Valid charset names are: `utf-8` `iso-8859-1`. |
| `invalid_form_data` | The method was called via a `POST` request with `Content-Type` `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`, but the form data was either missing or syntactically invalid. |
| `invalid_post_type` | The method was called via a `POST` request, but the specified `Content-Type` was invalid. Valid types are: `application/json` `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` `multipart/form-data` `text/plain`. |
| `missing_post_type` | The method was called via a `POST` request and included a data payload, but the request did not include a `Content-Type` header. |
| `request_timeout` | The method was called via a `POST` request, but the `POST` data was either missing or truncated. |

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended. |
| `superfluous_charset` | The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous. |
