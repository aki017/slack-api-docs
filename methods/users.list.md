This method returns a list of all users in the team. This includes deleted/deactivated users.

## Arguments

This method has the URL `https://slack.com/api/users.list` and follows the [Slack Web API calling conventions](/web#basics). <aside class="small">Present these parameters as part of an <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> querystring or POST body. <code>application/json</code> is not currently accepted.</aside>

| Argument | Example | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx` | Required | Authentication token.  
Requires scope: `users:read` |
| `cursor` | `dXNlcjpVMDYxTkZUVDI=` | Optional | Paginate through collections of data by setting the `cursor` parameter to a `next_cursor` attribute returned by a previous request's `response_metadata`. Default value fetches the first "page" of the collection. See [pagination](/docs/pagination) for more detail. |
| `limit` | `20` | Optional, default=0 | The maximum number of items to return. Fewer than the requested number of items may be returned, even if the end of the users list hasn't been reached. |
| `presence` | `true` | Optional | Whether to include presence data in the output. Setting this to `false` improves performance, especially with large teams. |

## Response

## Profile

The profile hash contains as much information as the user has supplied in the default profile fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `real_name`,`email`, `skype`, and the `image_*` fields. Only the `image_*` fields are guaranteed to be included. Data that has not been supplied may not be present at all, may be null or may contain the empty string ("").

A user's custom profile fields may be discovered using [`users.profile.get`](/methods/users.profile.get).

## Email addresses

Apps created after January 4th, 2017 must request _both_ the `users:read` and `users:read.email` [OAuth permission scopes](/docs/oauth-scopes) when using the [OAuth app installation flow](/docs/oauth) to enable access to the `email` field of user objects returned by this method.

## Pagination

This method uses cursor-based pagination to make it easier to incrementally collect information. To begin pagination, specify a `limit` value under `1000`. We recommend no more than `200` results at a time.

Responses will include a top-level `response_metadata` attribute containing a `next_cursor` value. By using this value as a `cursor` parameter in a subsequent request, along with `limit`, you may navigate through the collection page by virtual page.

See [pagination](/docs/pagination) for more information.

### Legacy behavior

At this time, providing no `limit` value will result in Slack attempting to deliver you the entire result set. If the collection is too large you may experience HTTP 500 errors. Resolve this scenario by using pagination.

One day pagination will become required to use this method.

## Errors

This table lists the expected errors that this method could return. However, other errors can be returned in the case where the service is down or other unexpected factors affect processing. Callers should _always_ check the value of the `ok` params in the response.

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `invalid_cursor` | Value passed for `cursor` was not valid or is no longer valid. |
| `not_authed` | No authentication token provided. |
| `invalid_auth` | Invalid authentication token. |
| `account_inactive` | Authentication token is for a deleted user or team. |
| `invalid_arg_name` | The method was passed an argument whose name falls outside the bounds of common decency. This includes very long names and names with non-alphanumeric characters other than `_`. If you get this error, it is typically an indication that you have made a _very_ malformed API call. |
| `invalid_array_arg` | The method was passed a PHP-style array argument (e.g. with a name like `foo[7]`). These are never valid with the Slack API. |
| `invalid_charset` | The method was called via a `POST` request, but the `charset` specified in the `Content-Type` header was invalid. Valid charset names are: `utf-8` `iso-8859-1`. |
| `invalid_form_data` | The method was called via a `POST` request with `Content-Type` `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`, but the form data was either missing or syntactically invalid. |
| `invalid_post_type` | The method was called via a `POST` request, but the specified `Content-Type` was invalid. Valid types are: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` `multipart/form-data` `text/plain`. |
| `missing_post_type` | The method was called via a `POST` request and included a data payload, but the request did not include a `Content-Type` header. |
| `team_added_to_org` | The team associated with your request is currently undergoing migration to an Enterprise Organization. Web API and other platform operations will be intermittently unavailable until the transition is complete. |
| `request_timeout` | The method was called via a `POST` request, but the `POST` data was either missing or truncated. |

## Warnings

This table lists the expected warnings that this method will return. However, other warnings can be returned in the case where the service is experiencing unexpected trouble.

| Warning | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_charset` | The method was called via a `POST` request, and recommended practice for the specified `Content-Type` is to include a `charset` parameter. However, no `charset` was present. Specifically, non-form-data content types (e.g. `text/plain`) are the ones for which `charset` is recommended. |
| `superfluous_charset` | The method was called via a `POST` request, and the specified `Content-Type` is not defined to understand the `charset` parameter. However, `charset` was in fact present. Specifically, form-data content types (e.g. `multipart/form-data`) are the ones for which `charset` is superfluous. |
