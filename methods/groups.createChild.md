This method takes an existing private channel and performs the following steps:

- Renames the existing private channel (from "example" to "example-archived").
- Archives the existing private channel.
- Creates a new private channel with the name of the existing private channel.
- Adds all members of the existing private channel to the new private channel.

This is useful when inviting a new member to an existing private channel while hiding all previous chat history from them. In this scenario you can call`groups.createChild` followed by `groups.invite`.

The new private channel will have a special `parent_group` property pointing to the original archived private channel. This will only be returned for members of both private channels, so will not be visible to any newly invited members.

## Arguments

This method has the URL `https://slack.com/api/groups.createChild` and follows the [Slack Web API calling conventions](/web#basics).
